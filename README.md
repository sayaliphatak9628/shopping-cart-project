# shopping-cart-project

As Kdramas, KPOP & KBeauty gain a massive following in India especially since the lockdown, Korean brands saw a surge in demand. So instead of creating a normal website, why not create one which has more demand in the world right now. And this is how I selected the topic Online Website for K-POP tshirts.

Technologies Used:
  VS Code
  Angular 8
  Bootstrap 4
  JSON service library (fake REST API Library - for server side)
  
  In this project, I have added few KPOP band's tshirts, filter function (by price), Add to Cart functionality, updating number of items in cart, Adding to Wishlist, Login page with Remember me functionality, and other pages without refreshing the whole website.
  
  http://localhost:4200 (actual website)
  http://localhost:3000/products (displays products)
  http://localhost:3000/cart (displays Add to cart items)
  http://localhost:3000/wishlist (displays wishlisted items)
